This dataset complements an investigation on rainfall-mediated fluxes of clay-forming and base-forming elements along soil catena crests. The crests occur along a climate gradient with three zones defined as 470 mm (4 crests) - 550 mm (6 crests) - 740 mm (4 crests) rainfall. There were two rock types uses for geochemical mass balance, one for the dry site and one for the two other zones. The rock and soil compositions are given for major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Ti) and Zr concentrations. These were used to calculate taus. The concentrations of base cations in the 14 crests are also given in the spreadsheet.
